### Project Description

This project offers a fairly simple login/register interface, and authentication-protected views of a database describing various products of a template store's inventory. Users can login, logout, view the list of products and their various properties, filter the list using multiple filter criteria, and edit properties of a particular product.

### Style Guide

For code submitted to frontend, we plan on using the recommended settings for eslint and the react-plugin for eslint.

For code submitted to backend, we plan on conforming to the pep8 standard by usage of pycodestyle, formerly known as pep8 (pip install pycodestyle)
